# Convex Best Practices

Apply these rules when working on Convex codebases.

## Rule loading order

1. Read `rules/convex-functions.md`.
2. Read `rules/convex-database.md`.
3. Read `rules/convex-realtime.md`.
4. Read `rules/convex-authentication.md`.
5. Read `rules/convex-scheduling.md`.
6. Read `rules/convex-file-storage.md`.
7. Read `rules/convex-search.md`.
8. Read `rules/convex-components.md`.
9. Use `AGENTS.md` as a compact summary plus pointer.

## Enforcement policy

- Use recommendation-first language for style and performance guidance.
- Use strict language (`must` / `must not`) only for security, correctness, or runtime constraints.
- Prefer official Convex docs when resolving conflicts; update these rules when docs change.
