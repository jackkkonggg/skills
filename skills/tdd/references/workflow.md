# TDD workflow details

Red-green evidence protects a retained or new contract. An explicitly authorized
deletion is not a bug to reproduce: remove tests for the retired behavior and
verify only durable neighboring outcomes. Do not add an absence test unless
absence is itself part of the agreed contract.

Prefer no new test over one that mostly tests mocks, mirrors current
implementation, depends on unrelated global state, or would be deleted
immediately after the fix.

For a flaky bug, isolate time, randomness, concurrency, and external state
before locking the signal down. Document what made the reproduction
deterministic.

If a focused bug exposes a wider failure class, land the narrow regression
first. Add sibling coverage only when it protects a distinct contract and does
not obscure the original evidence.

If failing-before evidence cannot be retained, record the exact command or
observation used and why a normal test was disproportionate.
